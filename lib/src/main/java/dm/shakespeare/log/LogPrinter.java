/**
 * Interface defining a log printer object responsible for formatting and writing the log messages.
 * <p>
 * A default printer instance can be set by invoking the proper logger methods. Note, however, that
 * the instance employed cannot be dynamically changed after the logger instantiation.
 * <br>
 * Note also that a printer instance is typically accessed from different threads, so, it is
 * responsibility of the implementing class to avoid concurrency issues by synchronizing mutable
 * fields when required.
 * <p>
 * To avoid an excessive number of log messages, it is sufficient to set an higher log level.
 * Though, it is also possible to completely remove the log source code (and related strings) from
 * the released code by using Proguard and adding, for example, the following rule to the
 * configuration file:
 * <pre><code>
 * -assumenosideeffects class dm.shakespeare.log.Logger {
 *   public void dbg(...);
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
