<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    The core module of the shakespeare library provides a lightweight implementation of an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a>.<br>
    The main concepts present in this module are:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/shakespeare/javadoc/1.0/lib/com/github/dm/shakespeare/actor/Behavior.html">Behavior</a>
<p>
    Interface defining an Actor behavior, that is, how the Actor reacts to start/stop events and
    newly received messages.<br>
    The library is designed so that, every piece of code in a Behavior implementation is executed
    sequentially in such a way that no other synchronization mechanism is needed.<br>
    A Behavior instance may represent a single state in a more complex state machine. In fact, it
    can be safely replaced at any moment during an Actor lifecycle.<br>
    Inside a Behavior it is also possible to create new Actor instances, and dismiss them when
    needed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/shakespeare/javadoc/1.0/lib/com/github/dm/shakespeare/actor/Behavior.Agent.html">Agent</a>
    <p>
        Interface defining an Actor execution environment.<br>
        An Agent provides to the Behavior instances information about the Actor state and several
        ways to control it.<br>
        Moreover, an Agent makes available references to utility classes such as a logger instance
        and executor services, employed to submit asynchronous tasks which are safely executed
        through the same actor synchronization mechanism.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/shakespeare/javadoc/1.0/lib/com/github/dm/shakespeare/actor/Role.html">Role</a>
    <p>
        Base class defining an Actor role.<br>
        A Role provides the needed configuration to set up the newly created Actor instance and its
        initial Behavior.
    </p>
</li>
</ul>
